swaync is not exactly "riced" but i made it look a bit cooler :)

I thought about it for a bit and now I'm conflicted on whether or not I should call it a rice lol
either way, it (kinda) works for me.
also, i stole most of the config files and stuff from various [#sources](https://github.com/almewr/hyprland-rice/blob/main/hackerman.png) :3

here's a screenshot:

# sources

- the Rei wallpaper: u/Momisato_OHOTNIK
- the Mt. Fuji wallpaper: I used this productivity app called [flocus](https://www.flocus.com) and it had this wallpaper so i yoinked it from there
- the waybar: its pretty much the same as the ["awe theme"](https://github.com/7KIR7/dots/tree/main/waybar/awe) i found but i added and removed some stuff
